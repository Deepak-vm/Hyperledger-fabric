# Assignment: Implementing a Multi- Organization Blockchain Network with Hyperledger Fabric

## Objective

To understand the architecture, components, and working of Hyperledger Fabric by setting
up a permissioned blockchain network with multiple organizations and channels, and
deploying chaincode (smart contract) for a sample use case.

## Background

Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain framework designed for enterprise
applications. It allows for modular architecture, pluggable consensus, and secure channels
between organizations. This assignment will give hands-on experience in network setup,
channel management, and chaincode deployment.

## Use Case: Digital Certificate Management System

You are tasked with building a basic blockchain network where:

- UniversityOrg issues certificates.
- StudentOrg can view their own certificates.
- VerifierOrg can verify the authenticity of certificates.

Each organization has its own peer node, and communication occurs over a shared channel.
A smart contract will manage certificate issuance and verification.

## Tasks

### 1. Network Setup

- Use Hyperledger Fabric Test Network (or build your own from scratch).
- Set up 3 organizations: UniversityOrg, StudentOrg, and VerifierOrg.
- Create a channel certchannel and join all peers to it.

### 2. Chaincode Development

- Write a simple chaincode (cert_cc) in Go/Node.js that allows:
- issueCertificate(studentID, certID, certHash, issuer)
- verifyCertificate(certID)
- getCertificate(certID)

### 3. Chaincode Deployment

- Deploy the chaincode to all peers in the network.
- Invoke chaincode using CLI or SDK to:
- Issue at least 3 certificates.
- Verify and query them.

### 4. Privacy and Access

- Ensure that StudentOrg cannot issue certificates.
- Only UniversityOrg has write access, others only read.

### 5. Documentation

- Include configuration files, scripts, and instructions.
- Write a report (3â€“4 pages) covering:
- Network architecture
- Channel creation process
- Chaincode logic
- Screenshots of peer joins, transactions, and query results

## Deliverables

- Project folder with:
- crypto-config, configtx.yaml, and docker-compose files
- Chaincode files
- Scripts for starting the network and invoking chaincode
- PDF report with documentation and screenshots
